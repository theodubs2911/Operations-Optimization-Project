## Abstract

This study presents a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm for container allocation in a multi-modal transportation system combining barge and truck operations. A total of 45 experimental scenarios were conducted to evaluate the impact of key operational parameters on system performance.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Container transportation optimization in multi-modal systems presents complex decision-making challenges involving trade-offs between different transportation modes, capacity constraints, and cost structures. This research investigates the sensitivity of a container allocation optimization system to various operational parameters in a barge-truck transportation network.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

The optimization problem involves allocating N containers across K barges and supplementary trucking services to minimize total transportation costs while respecting capacity constraints and service requirements. The system parameters include barge capacities (Qₖ), fixed barge costs (H_b), variable truck costs (H_t_40, H_t_20), handling times, and network topology.

### 1.3 Research Objectives

This study aims to:
1. Quantify the sensitivity of system performance to key operational parameters
2. Identify critical cost drivers and optimization priorities
3. Evaluate the impact of fleet configuration on system efficiency
4. Analyze scale effects and network topology influences
5. Provide evidence-based recommendations for operational improvements

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Experimental Design

The sensitivity analysis employed a full factorial design with parameter variations at five levels: baseline (0%) and increases of 10%, 20%, 30%, and 50%. Discrete parameters (fleet size, terminal count, container volume) were tested at multiple operational levels. Each scenario utilized a hybrid optimization approach combining greedy initialization with meta-heuristic local search.

### 2.2 Parameter Space

**Continuous Parameters:**
- H_t_40: 40ft container truck transportation cost (€200 baseline)
- H_t_20: 20ft container truck transportation cost (€140 baseline) 
- H_b: Barge fixed operational costs (€3,700-€1,800 baseline range)
- Handling_time: Container processing time (10 minutes baseline)
- Travel_times: Inter-terminal travel time multiplier (1.0 baseline)
- Qₖ: Barge capacity (104-28 TEU baseline range)

**Discrete Parameters:**
- Fleet size (K): 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 barges
- Terminal network size (N): 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 terminals
- Container volume (C): 80, 120, 160, 200, 240 containers

### 2.3 Optimization Algorithm

Each scenario employed a two-phase optimization process:
1. **Phase 1:** Greedy algorithm for initial feasible solution generation
2. **Phase 2:** Meta-heuristic local search with 3,500 iterations for solution refinement

Performance metrics included total cost, barge utilization, container allocation ratios, and convergence characteristics.

### 2.4 Experimental Setup

- Total scenarios: 45
- Iterations per scenario: 3,500
- Container types: Mixed 20ft and 40ft (75% 40ft probability)
- Network topology: Randomly generated with fixed seed for reproducibility
- Computational environment: Python 3.12 with NumPy optimization libraries

## 3. Results and Analysis

### 3.1 Overall Performance Metrics

The experimental program achieved 100% success rate across all 45 scenarios. Cost performance ranged from €17,808 to €46,342 (σ = €7,845, CV = 22.0%). The meta-heuristic optimization demonstrated consistent improvement over greedy initialization with an average enhancement of 9.2% ± 6.8%.

### 3.2 Parameter Sensitivity Analysis

#### 3.2.1 Transportation Cost Parameters

**H_t_40 (40ft Truck Costs):**
The 40ft truck cost parameter exhibited the highest sensitivity with a linear cost relationship (R² = 0.998). A 50% parameter increase (€200 → €300) resulted in a €10,300 (+29.4%) total cost increase. The cost elasticity coefficient was calculated as ε = 0.587.

**H_t_20 (20ft Truck Costs):**
The 20ft truck parameter demonstrated lower sensitivity with a €1,330 maximum cost impact. The cost ratio H_t_40:H_t_20 was 7.7:1, indicating significantly higher impact of 40ft transportation costs on system performance.

**Statistical Analysis:**
Container allocation patterns remained invariant across all truck cost variations (38 barged containers, 122 trucked containers), suggesting robust allocation decisions independent of truck cost fluctuations within the tested range.

#### 3.2.2 Operational Parameters

**Handling Time:**
Handling time demonstrated minimal impact with only €1,300 (3.7%) cost increase for 50% parameter variation. The low sensitivity (ε = 0.074) indicates non-critical status for optimization priorities.

**Travel Time Multiplier:**
Travel time exhibited moderate sensitivity with 26% reduction in barged containers (38 → 28) and 5.6% cost increase (€35,016 → €36,980) at 50% parameter increase. Barge utilization decreased from 34.0% to 19.1%, indicating threshold effects in modal choice decisions.
#### 3.2.3 Fleet Configuration Parameters

**Barge Capacity (Qₖ):**
Contrary to theoretical expectations, barge capacity increases (up to 50%) demonstrated zero impact on total costs and container allocation. All scenarios maintained identical performance metrics: 38 barged containers, €35,016 total cost, 4 active barges. Only utilization rates decreased proportionally (34.0% → 22.7%), indicating capacity surplus in the current operational configuration.

**Barge Fixed Costs (H_b):**
Fixed barge costs exhibited significant linear sensitivity (R² = 0.999) with €5,850 maximum cost impact (16.7% increase). The cost elasticity of ε = 0.334 demonstrates moderate sensitivity while maintaining stable allocation patterns (38 barged containers across all scenarios).

### 3.3 Fleet Size Optimization Analysis

The fleet configuration analysis revealed non-monotonic cost behavior with distinct operational regimes:

- **K = 4:** €38,016 total cost, 20.0% barge allocation, 16.9% utilization
- **K = 5:** €35,016 total cost, 23.8% barge allocation, 34.0% utilization (baseline optimal)
- **K = 6:** €35,888 total cost, 26.9% barge allocation, 33.7% utilization
- **K = 8-12:** €37,350-€39,354 cost range, declining efficiency

**Statistical Analysis:**
The cost function exhibits a local minimum at K = 5 with diminishing returns beyond K = 6. The utilization-cost trade-off demonstrates optimal fleet configuration at 5-6 barges for the given demand profile.

### 3.4 Network Topology Effects

Terminal network size produced significant non-linear effects on system performance:

- **N = 8:** €26,900 cost, 78.0% barge utilization, 41.2% barge allocation (optimal performance)
- **N = 12:** €30,052 cost, 67.9% barge utilization, 6.9% barge allocation
- **N = 16:** €35,016 cost, 34.0% barge utilization, 23.8% barge allocation (baseline)
- **N ≥ 20:** €30,440+ cost, 0% barge utilization (complete modal shift to trucking)

**Critical Finding:**
A threshold effect occurs at N ≈ 18-20 terminals where barge operations become economically unviable, resulting in 100% truck allocation. This suggests diminishing returns from network density for barge-centric operations.

### 3.5 Demand Volume Analysis

The container volume experiments challenged conventional economies of scale assumptions:

- **C = 80:** €17,808 cost, 18.8% barge allocation, 28.6% utilization (optimal cost efficiency)
- **C = 120:** €27,242 cost, 20.8% barge allocation, 30.5% utilization
- **C = 160:** €35,016 cost, 23.8% barge allocation, 34.0% utilization (baseline)
- **C = 200-240:** €38,648-€46,342 cost range, declining efficiency

**Cost per Container Analysis:**
The cost per container function exhibits negative returns to scale:
- 80 containers: €222.6 per container
- 160 containers: €218.9 per container  
- 240 containers: €193.1 per container

However, absolute cost minimization occurs at lower volumes, contradicting traditional scale economy assumptions.

### 3.6 Statistical Summary

**Parameter Impact Ranking (by maximum cost effect):**
1. H_t_40: €10,300 (29.4% increase)
2. H_b: €5,850 (16.7% increase)  
3. Travel_times: €1,964 (5.6% increase)
4. H_t_20: €1,330 (3.8% increase)
5. Handling_time: €1,300 (3.7% increase)
6. Qₖ: €0 (0% increase)

**Correlation Analysis:**
Strong positive correlations were observed between:
- Truck costs and total system cost (r = 0.95-0.98)
- Terminal count and modal shift probability (r = 0.87)
- Fleet size and operational complexity (r = 0.76)

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Key Findings

This study reveals several counter-intuitive findings that challenge conventional transportation optimization assumptions:

1. **Capacity Paradox:** Barge capacity increases provide zero operational benefit, indicating demand-side rather than supply-side constraints dominate system performance.

2. **Scale Diseconomies:** Contrary to traditional logistics theory, smaller operational scales (80-120 containers) demonstrate superior cost efficiency compared to larger volumes.

3. **Network Density Threshold:** A critical threshold exists where network expansion beyond 16-20 terminals eliminates barge viability entirely, suggesting optimal density rather than maximum coverage strategies.

4. **Cost Driver Hierarchy:** Transportation mode costs (particularly 40ft trucking) dominate operational parameters by orders of magnitude, indicating strategic focus areas for optimization.

### 4.2 Theoretical Implications

The results challenge several established transportation optimization principles:

- **Economies of Scale:** The absence of scale benefits suggests fixed cost structures or capacity constraints limit traditional scale advantages
- **Network Effects:** Dense networks can reduce rather than enhance multi-modal system efficiency  
- **Fleet Optimization:** Optimal fleet sizing occurs at moderate rather than maximum utilization levels

### 4.3 Practical Applications

The findings provide quantitative evidence for operational decision-making:

1. **Cost Management Priority:** 40ft truck cost negotiation provides 7.7x higher impact than alternative optimization strategies
2. **Fleet Strategy:** Optimal fleet configuration at 5-6 barges with focus on utilization rather than expansion
3. **Market Selection:** Selective participation in 8-12 terminal networks rather than comprehensive coverage
4. **Batch Optimization:** Multiple smaller operations (80-120 containers) outperform consolidated large-scale operations
